# Chatroom (Group AutoMate)
We decided to extend our Lab 6 rather than make a whole new project, thanks to a group-wide lack of time in the final weeks due to other projects.

In addition to the basic Lab 6 functionality, we also have added:

## Search Functionality
When a user is in a room, they can type anything in the search box (located at the top of the screen) and only the messages containing what the user typed will be shown.

## Like/Dislike (Reactions)
A user can click the "like" or "dislike" buttons to the left of a message to add a like or dislike to the message.

## Edit Message
A pencil icon will appear only next to messages sent by the user who is currently logged in. When clicked, a form is shown. When the user enters a new message in the form and clicks "submit," a new message will be sent noting the old message and the message after its edit.
